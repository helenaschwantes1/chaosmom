  <h2>About Chaos Mom</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm Lena — a data engineer, mom, and chaos coordinator. I created this blog to share real-life tips, routines, and hacks that help bring a little calm to the beautiful mess of motherhood.</p>
  <p>Here, we don’t chase perfection — we build systems that work *most* of the time.</p>
